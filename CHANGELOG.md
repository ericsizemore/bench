  * The `startTime`, `endTime`, and `memoryUsage` properties of `Bench` are now initialized with default values.
    * `hasStarted()` and `hasEnded()` now check for default value, instead of an `isset` check.
  * Update `README.md` to split contributing information to its own file.
  * Updated this changelog to more closely follow the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format.
  * Update `.gitattributes` to reduce tarball size.

  * Fixes to resolve issues reported by Psalm.

### Removed

  * Removed `.php-cs-fixer.cache`, should never have been added to repo.

## [3.1.0] - 2024-03-26

### Changed

  * Replace usage of `microtime` with `hrtime`
    * Noticed some potential issues that didn't make this too simple of a switch.
  * Reworked `readableElapsedTime` (in both `Bench` and `BenchInterface`) and `getTime`.
    * `readableElapsedTime` now accepts time as seconds, which is derived by `$endTime - $startTime / 1e9`.
      * Due to this, the named argument `$microtime` is now `$seconds`.
